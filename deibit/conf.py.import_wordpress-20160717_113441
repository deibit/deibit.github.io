# If you want to use Nikola with a non-supported language you have to provide

# in the default language will be shown instead.

# What is the default language?

# If you have a page something.rst, then something.pl.rst will be considered
# its Polish translation.
#     (in the above example: path == "something", ext == "rst", lang == "pl")
# this pattern is also used for metadata:

# Links for the sidebar / navigation bar.  (translatable)
# This is a dict.  The keys are languages, and values are tuples.

# WARNING: Support for submenus is theme-dependent.
#          Only one level of submenus is supported.
# WARNING: Some themes, including the default Bootstrap 3 theme,

#          (in bootstrap3, the navbar can grow too large and cover contents.)
# WARNING: If you link to directories, make sure to follow
