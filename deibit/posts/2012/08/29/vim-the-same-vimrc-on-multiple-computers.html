<html><body><p>Reading this <a href="http://usevim.com/2012/08/29/conditional-vimrc/">post</a> I remember that I never commented here the way I (and a lot of people) use to share the same vimrc on different computers. Instead of doing it as that post says (which is not a great idea because an ‘ack’ may exists in OSX systems via port or homebrew) you can actually differentiate computers by…its name!…surprised?</p>
<p>Vim has a handy function called ‘hostname’. So, easy, just store it in a variable and let the music go:</p>
<p>let computername=hostname()</p>
<p>Now you can adapt your preferences between your computers. For example you can have a laptop with a little screen and a big iMac with a stunning 27 inch display. Obviously your columns and lines would not be the same.</p>
<p>How do you solve it? Come in, you are welcome to comment. I promise I won’t delete your contribution ;)</p>
