<html><body><p>Ok, I used a very basic setup for folding. Just put ‘set foldmethod=marker’ in my .vimrc and leave the marker as is set by default, this is: {{{ for start a fold and }}} for end it.</p>
<p>I haven’t any other set, so it just works fine but I need to “manually” set the folds. A little price I don’t mind to pay. </p>
<p>Well, let’s say you got a big class on Python but you want to hidden in a fold.</p>
<p>- Select the whole body class with ‘V}’<br>
- put :fold</p>
<p>And that’s all. You got a fold.</p>
<p>The rest is the usually commands on folding:</p>
<p>zo, zc open and close a fold<br>
zO, zC open/close all folds<br>
zR, zM same as former but sets fold level to highest/0 level</p>
