<html><body><p>My MacBook Pro is getting older so in order to save some CPU cycles (so I can run more and more VM machines) I managed to find a command able to disable SpotLight Indexing Service. Frankly, I donâ€™t use Spotlight after all, instead I just have a shortcut or launch Launchpad for the apps more frequently used.</p>
<p>To disable indexing in Spotlight type this in a terminal:</p>
<p>$ sudo mdutil -i off </p>
<p>If you got more than one volume you can add: -a</p>
<p>If you regret and want to get back Spotlight, just:</p>
<p>$ sudo mdutil -a -i on</p>
