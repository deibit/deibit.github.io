<p>[sourcecode]netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=yourchoice key=againyourchoice[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>You can set ‘ssid’ and ‘key’ to whatever fits to you.</p>
<p>Next let’s start the AP:</p>
<p>[sourcecode]netsh wlan start hostednetwork[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>When you’re finish:</p>
<p>[sourcecode]netsh wlan stop hostednetwork[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>‘netsh’ seems to be a very useful tool with a miriad of options. Would be worth to take time to explore it.</p>
