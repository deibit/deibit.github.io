<html><body><p>I forgot to mention here in my blog a web pentest tool I’m making: <a href="https://github.com/deibit/cansina">Cansina</a>. Is just a little tool to discover by dictionary hidden content in a website. Useful (I hope) while doing web security assessment.   It is code in Python and accepts list of entries in plain text files that will use to tireless ask the website. It has a couple of interesting options and more is to come. If you are a pentester take a look at it. I hope it would be useful for you.</p>
