<html><body><p>Another write up on Damo’s Challenges. This time was the turn for VII and the topic was on WiFi caps. Really fun.</p>
<p>All we got are some packets captured by a guy. A packet capture and some csv files from kismet, etc. We need to decrypt the packets to get the “conversation” in clear text. So we need the WEP key.</p>
<p>If we try to use aircrack-ng with the capture it will say that the IV (initialization vector) are insufficient in number. So, how are we gonna manage to get the key?…The used router was an Eircom one. Googling it the results says some of them contains a weak algorithm when they make the default WEP key. In one of the csv files you can see the SSID of the router: “Eircom1234 5670″. Putting it in<a href="http://www.bacik.ie/eircomwep/"> this online key generator </a>brings us some WEP keys.</p>

<p>Using airdecap-ng with the key on the capture file output the decrypted version of the file:</p>

<p>And opening the file with wireshark shows a nice view of the capture.</p>
<p>damo.clanteam.com resolves to 67.220.217.235, filtering by this IP in Wireshark…</p>

<p>Looking for the right request we can see the Basic Authentication token and just by decoding it (base64):</p>
<p>YWRtaW46eDRnaDlpMTA= -&gt; admin:x4gh9i10</p>
<p>We got the user/pass. The url to go is in the capture too:</p>
<p>damo.clanteam.com/sch7/updatehof</p>
<p>That’s all. We are done.</p>
